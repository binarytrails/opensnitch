Rules can be edited from the GUI, by clicking on the name of the rule:

(Since v1.2.0, all rules comparison are case-insensitive by the default for destination host, process path and process arguments.)


#### Parameters

[x] Enable - Enables or disables the rule.

[x] Priority -  Indicates that this rule has precedence over the rest.

[x] Case sensitive - Make the comparison case-sensitive for ALL fields.

[x] Duration - Always writes the rule to disk.

---

Each field can be literal or a regex expression.

Some examples:

- Filtering by multiple ports: 

    `[x] To this port: ^(53|80|443)$`

    targets ports 53 OR 80 OR 443.

    `[x] To this port: ^555[12345]$`

    targets ports 5551, 5552, 5553, 5554 OR 5555.

- Filtering by an exact domain, and nothing else: `[x] To this host: github.com` (will match only github.com, not www.github.com, etc)
- Filtering by a domain and its subdomains: `[x] To this host: .*\.github.com`
- Filtering an executable path: 

    `[x] From this executable: /usr/bin/python3`
     
    (warning: /usr/bin/python3.6/3.7/3.8/etc won't match this rule)

- Allow common system commands:
  ```
  Name: 000-allow-system-cmds
  Action: Allow
  [x] Priority rule
  [x] From this executable: ^(/usr/sbin/ntpd|/lib/systemd/systemd-timesyncd|/usr/bin/xbrlapi|/usr/bin/dirmngr)$
  [x] To this port: ^(53|123)$
  [x] From this User ID: ^(0|115|118)$
  ```

- Blocking connections made by executables launched from /tmp:
    ```
    Action:                   Deny
    [x] From this executable: /tmp/.*
    ```

- Filtering an executable path with regexp, for example any python binary in /usr/bin/:

    `[x] From this executable: ^/usr/bin/python[0-9\.]*$`

     Case insensitive rules:

    `[x] From this executable: (?i:.*ping)`

- Filtering LAN IPs or multiple ranges:
     ^(127\..*|172\..*|192.168\..*|10\..*)$

See these issues for some discussions and more examples: [#17](https://github.com/gustavo-iniguez-goya/opensnitch/issues/17), [#31](https://github.com/gustavo-iniguez-goya/opensnitch/issues/31), [#73](https://github.com/gustavo-iniguez-goya/opensnitch/issues/73)

**Note:** Don't use "," to specify domains, IPs, etc. It's not supported. For example this won't work (it could be added if you complain loud enough):

> [x] To this host: www.example.org, www.test.me

**Note:** Golang does not support Perl syntax (like (?!...))

However you can use negated chars classes. For example, block all outgoing connections, except those to localhost:

`[x] Action: deny`

`[x] To this destination IP: [^:127.0.0.1:]`

**Unconditionally blocking lists**

As of v1.0.0rc10 there's no support for blocking or allowing connections ignoring the rest of the rules (see [#36](https://github.com/gustavo-iniguez-goya/opensnitch/issues/36)).

But you can achieve it using iptables:
- Allow ICMP:
`iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT`

- Allow localhost connections:
`iptables -t mangle -I OUTPUT -d 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT`

Note on allowing all connections to localhost:

While it might be seem obvious to allow everything to localhost, be aware that you might want to allow only certain connections/programs:
